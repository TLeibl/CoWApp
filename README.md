Corona-Warn-App
Platform: Android
Status: 2021

This app was developed as part of a lecture. It is an alternative to the official Corona-Warn-App (Germany).
Direct and indirect contacts of the user are tracked via Bluetooth and GPS and stored anonymously in a server database. The data remains here for 2 weeks 
and is then deleted.
If the user falls ill with COVID-19 and reports this, all contacts are automatically notified via the app.
The application also provides information on how to behave in the event of a suspected or existing infection with COVID-19 and an assessment of how high 
the current personal health risk is.
